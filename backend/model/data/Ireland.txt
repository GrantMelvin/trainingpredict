TnG Bench - 245x4x4 - felt good with consistent setup but not like weeks ago when it was weightless 
W20D1 - 10/14/19
Comp Squat - 455x1x1, 325x1x3 - single was on the better side considering bad sleep the night before, fork chest in a more upright position to get more rebound out of the hole, could’ve hit 475 after but it would’ve been ugly 
Comp Bench - 295x1x1, 225x3x3 - smooth single
W20D2 - 10/15/19
Comp Deadlift - 455x1x1, 315x1x3 - fatigued from yesterday, so sick of training
Comp Bench - 275x1x2, 265x2x2 - top double was very fast, backoffs were difficult because of mental climax on top set
W20D3 - 10/17/19
Pin Squat - 440x1x1, 365x2x2 - single was rpe 9-9.5 smooth, everything in this prep is mental burnout and the strength is there 
Comp Bench - 280,265x2x2 - PR double with ammonia, first rep very smooth second one took a year
W20D4 - 10/19/19
Comp Deadlift - 495x1x1, 405x1x3 - best single of prep no question, was rpe 8.5 
TnG Bench - 260x2x3 - surprisingly easier than previous TnG sessions, maybe even a rep pr 
W21D1 - 10/21/19
Comp Squat - 450x1x1, 390x3x2 - squat is such a shitshow, can’t decide on form and sleep is bad
Comp Bench - 270x1x1, 245x3x2 - warmups flying, dialed in, single was smooth, back off sets were solid, form coming back 
W21D2 - 10/22/19
Comp Deadlift - 470x1x1, 425x2x2 - Opener was 8.5 even with soreness and ache from yesterday’s session, backoffs were slower than anticipated but technically sound, knee/hip/hamstring ache 
Comp Bench - 245x4x1 - easy as it should be
W21D4 - 10/25/19 - 2 days before competition
Comp Squat - 406x1x1, 352x2x2 - Single very heavy due to jet lag and lack of sleep, probably dropping opener 5kg
Comp Bench - 245x1x1, 225x2x2 - easy
Comp Deadlift - 425x1x1
